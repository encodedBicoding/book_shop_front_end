Hi, Welcome to Quidax book club. 

Reading is fun, I do hope you will enjoy it here. coffee is being served too ;).

Hey, You begin now...

Visit the book club official website hosted on my Github pages on...

While Grid layouts and CSS Flex layouts are fun technologies to use. I basically used Flex for my Layouts.

Flickity was really a fun tool to work with. Thanks for the heads up.

I decided to make things a little easy for me and you (well that's the point of software development afterall), so I uploaded my work online, you do not need to worry about where
the entry files is now, just click. https://encodedbicoding.github.io/book_shop_front_end/public/

### FOLDERS AND WHAT THEY CONTAIN.

# /public
This folder contains HTML files

# /src
This folder contains over 300 lines of javascript code. lol. it may need some refactoring later. I also
created a books data array to dynamically fill up some HTML pages.

# /styles
This folder contains all the styles used in this project.

# Blockers
The algorithm used on the search box is still inefficient. I will keep working on that even after submitting.

# Mobile Responsiveness
This project focuses on the iPhone6/7/8 Plus with viewport of 414 * 736

Alright, That will be all the information I dish out today.

Thank you!.
